Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
13 is in a2

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
the result 12 is in a1 directly, it seems that main compute this inline and store it

At what address is the function printf located?
0000000000000630 <printf>:

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
jump and link register: jalr rd, offset(rs1)
pc + 4 -> rd then jump to offset(rs1)
0x30 -> 0x38 -> 0x5e -> 0x68 ->0x70

unsigned int i = 0x00646c72; 
printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
输出的内容为 HE110 World  小端表示，57616 -> 0xE110
                                0x00646c72 -> 72 c6 64 00
                                               r  l  d  \0

出现未定义行为，输出取决于之前a2中的数据
